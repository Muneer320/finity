    1.  **Quick Win:** Find one positive aspect (e.g., consistency, low spending in a non-essential area, or simply logging daily).
    2.  **Awareness Check:** Address the highest spending category identified in the data. Frame it as an opportunity.
    3.  **Next Step Nudge:** Provide ONE specific, behaviorally-informed action to reduce spending in that highest category.
